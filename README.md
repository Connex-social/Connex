# Connex

Web3 provides young individuals – regardless of job position – the ability to become an expert in this growing field without having to climb the decades-long latter to reach a level where you can contribute meaningfully to a company or specific field of work. The smartest people in the world are moving into Web3 – exiting FANG companies – and joining crypto companies or DAOs. 

However, there is no places to provide such information in a decentralized way. With token incentives, talents are willing to update their CV and Connex could integrate on-chain credential with their uploaded CV. With such on-chain and off-chain personal credentials, Crypto Companies, social DAOs, protocol DAOs, NFT gated DAOs, investment DAOs and more are attracted to the platform and further boost people's adoption. These on-chain and off-chain integrated credential help people to create their own web3 professional community. 

Connex aims to build a permissionless, open, and collaborative Web3 professional network. The CONX token is an essential component to such infrastructures as it functions as the governance token, incentivizes user participation, and serves as the primary payment token of the Connex ecosystem. 

Connex is designed to reward high integrity and proof of fraud. CONX tokens are used to reward the platform users. CONX can be used for rewarding people who upload their CVs with high integrity, or reward people who get most viewed and liked. People who prove the additional credit of CV and KOL who create circles on Connex and share their valuable views about the circle topics are also welcomed by the platform.
